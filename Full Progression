Progression

Main progression layout: Immersive Enginering > Tinkers Construct > Industrialcraft > Thermal Series > Futurepack > Applied Energistics 2 > Extreme Reactors > Botania > industrial foregoing > Mekanism > Twilight Forest > Thaumcraft > Project E > Advanced Rocketry > Nuclearcraft > Aether 

Introduce Mystical Agriculture at the same time as Tinker's  
Introduce Tardis as one of many end goals right before the aether
Introduce the Twilight Forest as a bonus around the Extreme Reactors age


Starting Mod: Immersive Engineering
Main Objectives:
Make Coke Oven: make coke brick by combining 4 brick blocks, 4 nether brick blocks, and a coal block together for 3 coke bricks. > Make blast bricks
Make steel: make the blast furnace by using 1 pyrotheum dust, 4 coke brick, and 4 nether brick blocks which will give you 3 blast brick blocks > put Iron in the Blast Furnace with coal coke.




General Recipe Changes
Most things that require iron will require steel instead.  Vanilla tools will not be subject to this, just modded items.  
Some things will have bronze instead of just copper as long as it makes sense.
The recipe for beds will be gated behind getting to the Aether and will only be found in villages specifically to set your spawn point
Glowstone dust will be made with Made with 3 redstone and 1 pyrotheum to make 8 glowstone dust.
Tinkers Construct Seared Stone Bricks will need 1 seared stone poured over a coke brick in the porcelain melter

Other information
Glowstone will not naturally spawn, it will need to be created with Nuclearcraft isotopes
Glowstone dust will have a new recipe as well and not contribute to the Glowstone bblock recipe.

Mekanism requires IF's plastic, latex, and bioreactor
Twilight forest requires Mekanism Osmium which can only be created by allowing the Industrial foregoing ingot from the runic altar with manasteel
thaumcraft crystals only spawn in the twilight forest
Project E needs Thaumcraft research (still undecided)
Advanced rocketry needs dark Matter, Red Matter, and Aeternis fuel.
