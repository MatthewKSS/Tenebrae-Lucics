Starting Mod: Immersive Engineering
Main Objectives:
Make Coke Oven: make coke brick by combining 4 brick blocks, 4 nether brick blocks, and a coal block together for 3 coke bricks. > Make blast bricks
Make steel: make the blast furnace by using 1 pyrotheum dust, 4 coke brick, and 4 nether brick blocks which will give you 3 blast brick blocks > put Iron in the Blast Furnace with coal coke.




General Recipe Changes
Most things that require iron will require steel instead.  Vanilla tools will not be subject to this, just modded items.  
Some things will have bronze instead of just copper as long as it makes sense.
The recipe for beds will be gated behind getting to the Aether
