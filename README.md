# Tenebrae-Lucis
Darkness within the Light
\
\
The world is in an eternal darkness caused by the nearing end of the universe. Your objective is to survive and make your way to the higher plane where it is always day.\
This will not be easy.  The radiation levels are high, changing the atomic composition of the items you need to create to get to the higher plane.\
Monsters have become sentient and seem to search you out to ensure your destruction, they're all around and will not give up no matter how much you fight.\
Create machines and weapons to survive this eternal darkness.  You have no means to sleep, the world is brutally cold, it's always raining and wet, and your hope is low.\
Because of the rain, some monsters you need to progress will only spawn in cave systems or under cover from the rain. Villages are sparse, but still inhabited.\
Get your way to the Higher Plane and find Tenebrae Lucis.\
